# minnesota-popdensity-2016
a visualization of Minnesota's population density using d3.js and topojson

### How to generate the final topojson
Change direction to `intermediate` then run `prepare.sh` to install dependencies.
Then run `scripts.sh` to generate all those intermediate files. At last,
`mn-topo.json` will be generated and could be used to draw the visualization.
